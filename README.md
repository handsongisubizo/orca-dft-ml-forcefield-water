# ORCA DFT-Based Machine Learning Force Field for Water Molecules

This project develops a high-accuracy machine learning force field for water clusters using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations from ORCA. The trained model will replicate quantum-level interactions and be validated against experimental data and classical models such as TIP3P and SPC/E.

> Project Status: In Progress â€” Files, data, and training results will be uploaded progressively.
